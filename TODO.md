# Todo

- in-kind donation recording for goods and services
    - donor field search/autocomplete
- autocomplete for buyer_numbers
- admin dashboard/reports
- add images to AuctionItems (https://github.com/alexsdutton/django-camera-imagefield ?)
- manually enter buyer numbers
- cancel button on "record auction bid" page does nothing...

## Dashboard/Reports

- Sales Stats
- All Receipts?
- Dollars over time graph?
- Auction Booklet?

# Done
- payments with CC need multiple steps to correctly calculate fees (must fix)
- search buyers by name, number, address
- Buyers should really be Patrons
- priced item editing should synchronize amount paid and fmv
- add fee model to record CC purchase fees paid
- the widget for amounts/money should have a $ tied to the form-field
